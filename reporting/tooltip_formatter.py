Centralised tooltip system for the NSE/BSE Analyser Excel dashboard.

Session 16 (final push): replaces the legacy "💡 short\\n\\nfull" comment style
with a polished, structured hover + visible ⓘ header cue + rich Tooltip
Reference sheet.

Public API:
    TIPS                            — dict[header_name] -> (short, full)
    format_tooltip(header, short, full) -> str
    apply_tooltips(ws, header_row, col_headers,
                   add_cue=True, ref_anchors=None) -> None
    build_reference_sheet(wb, after_sheet=None) -> dict[header -> row]

Design notes:
- Openpyxl writes only the legacy (VML) comment format, so we cannot style
  the hover box itself (yellow background, Tahoma font, callout arrow are
  drawn by Excel). Everything we CAN control — text layout, icons, box
  dimensions — is polished here.
- The visible ⓘ cue on the header tells users a tooltip exists without
  requiring them to hover blindly.
- The Tooltip Reference sheet is the main "modern" visual upgrade — full
  colour, borders, typography — linked from every header via hyperlink.
