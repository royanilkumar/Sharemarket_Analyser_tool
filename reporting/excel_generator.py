def _patch_tooltip_vml(xlsx_path):
    """Session 27+28+29+v10.12: Post-process .xlsx to fix tooltip VML shapes.

    Four things this function does that openpyxl won't:

    1. Box dimensions, per-tooltip (v10.12 dynamic sizing).
       openpyxl writes VML shapes with hardcoded 144×79px regardless of what
       Comment.width/height are set to. Pre-v10.12 we rewrote every shape to
       a fixed 420×380 px — which caused short tooltips (e.g., Stop Loss:
       2 short lines) to show with 60-70% empty space below. Now we parse
       xl/comments1.xml to get the text of each comment, map it to its shape
       via (row, col) anchor, and size the box to fit the actual content:
         width  = 420px  (standard)
         height = clamp(17 * line_count + 36, min=85, max=380)
       Line heuristic: tooltip text uses \\n separators; each line ~17px high
       with ~36px chrome (title bar + padding).

    2. Anchor direction for right-side columns (Session 29). openpyxl sets
       `margin-left:59.25pt` on every shape, which pushes the comment box
       to the RIGHT of the anchor cell. On the rightmost few columns of a
       sheet, the box gets clipped or hidden off-screen. We scan each
       drawing's shapes to find the rightmost anchor column, then for any
       shape whose column is in the right portion of the sheet, flip the
       margin to a negative value so the box opens to the LEFT of the cell.
       Threshold: any column at >= 70% of the rightmost tooltipped column
       index on that sheet gets flipped.

    3. Nothing for scrolling. VML comments do not support internal
       scrollbars (that's a threaded-comments feature). We size the box
       for the known-tallest tooltip content plus padding.

        # descending priority (T3 → T2 → T1). So T2_HIT can only fire on a
        # single-bar leap from below T1 to above T2 — a median 13.9

        # therefore permanent zeros by construction, not for lack of data.

        # the day after T1 to the position's OWN expiry date. It is purely

        # is realised P&L and nothing here alters hit rate or SL rate.
