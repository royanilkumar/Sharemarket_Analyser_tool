        gate the BUY verdict — see MIN_INFORMED_FOR_BUY.

        Counting rules (each adds 1 if the test passes):
          1. Fundamental  — fundamental_score deviates ≥ 6 from its base band
                            (base is 45-55 depending on Stage 2 score; deviation
                            of 6+ means at least one moderate bucket actually fired)
          2. Technical    — technical_score deviates ≥ 6 from neutral 50
                            (at least one BUY/SELL signal or a strong indicator)
          3. Safety       — safety_score deviates ≥ 6 from neutral 50
                            (real safety signal — pledge, debt, FCF, BS health, etc.)
          4. Sentiment    — sentiment_is_informed flag (already computed upstream
                            from the 6 paid/AI signal presence check)
          5. Early Entry  — early_entry_score > 0 (EE has zero base; any score
                            means at least one early-mover signal fired)

        Why ±6 and not exact-equals-base? Because cap-tier base for fundamental
        ranges 45-55. A test of 'deviation > 0' would always pass (Stage 2 score
        is non-zero by definition). 6 points means at least one moderate bucket

        Session 24: Enriched verdict derivation.

        Returns dict with:
          verdict           — one of BUY, OVERVALUED, WATCHLIST, NEUTRAL, AVOID
          confidence        — one of HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW (based on distance from threshold)
          display           — e.g., "BUY ●●●", "OVERVALUED ●●○", "WATCHLIST ●○○"
          data_gate_applied — True if BUY was demoted to WATCHLIST by the
                              v10.17 data-completeness guard

        Verdict rules:
          AVOID       — score < 38 (universal floor)
          BUY         — score ≥ cap-adjusted BUY threshold AND MoS passes gate
                        AND informed_count ≥ MIN_INFORMED_FOR_BUY (v10.17)
          OVERVALUED  — score ≥ cap-adjusted BUY threshold BUT MoS gate blocks
                        (great business, but currently expensive)
          WATCHLIST   — score in WATCHLIST band (between BUY threshold and AVOID floor)
                        OR score above BUY threshold but data too sparse (v10.17)
          NEUTRAL     — 38 ≤ score < WATCHLIST threshold

        Confidence rules (distance from the threshold the verdict clears):
          HIGH   — ≥ 5 points above the decisive threshold
          MEDIUM — 2–5 points above the decisive threshold
          LOW    — within 2 points of the threshold (cliff zone)

        v10.17 data-completeness guard:
          If a stock would qualify for BUY (score and MoS both pass) but has
          fewer than MIN_INFORMED_FOR_BUY informed sub-score dimensions, the
          BUY is demoted to WATCHLIST. The display string is annotated with
          "(thin data)" so the user can see why. OVERVALUED is unaffected
          (a great-but-expensive call already advises waiting). NEUTRAL and
          AVOID are unaffected (they're already conservative).
